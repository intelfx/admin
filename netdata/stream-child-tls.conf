# netdata configuration for aggregating data from remote hosts
#
# API keys authorize a pair of sending-receiving netdata servers.
# Once their communication is authorized, they can exchange metrics for any
# number of hosts.
#
# You can generate API keys, with the linux command: uuidgen


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. ON CHILD NETDATA - THE ONE THAT WILL BE SENDING METRICS

[stream]
    # Enable this on child nodes, to have them send metrics.
    enabled = yes

    # Where is the receiving netdata?
    # A space separated list of:
    #
    #      [PROTOCOL:]HOST[%INTERFACE][:PORT][:SSL]
    #
    # If many are given, the first available will get the metrics.
    #
    # PROTOCOL  = tcp, udp, or unix (only tcp and unix are supported by parent nodes)
    # HOST      = an IPv4, IPv6 IP, or a hostname, or a unix domain socket path.
    #             IPv6 IPs should be given with brackets [ip:address]
    # INTERFACE = the network interface to use (only for IPv6)
    # PORT      = the port number or service name (/etc/services)
    # SSL       = when this word appear at the end of the destination string
    #             the Netdata will encrypt the connection with the parent.
    #
    # This communication is not HTTP (it cannot be proxied by web proxies).
    destination = tcp:stratofortress.nexus.i.intelfx.name:19998:SSL

    # Skip Certificate verification?
    # The netdata child is configurated to avoid invalid SSL/TLS certificate,
    # so certificates that are self-signed or expired will stop the streaming.
    # Case the server certificate is not valid, you can enable the use of
    # 'bad' certificates setting the next option as 'yes'.
    ssl skip certificate verification = no

    # Certificate Authority Path
    # OpenSSL has a default directory where the known certificates are stored.
    # In case it is necessary, it is possible to change this rule using the variable
    # "CApath", e.g. CApath = /etc/ssl/certs/
    #
    #CApath =

    # Certificate Authority file
    # When the Netdata parent has a certificate that is not recognized as valid,
    # we can add it to the list of known certificates in "CApath" and give it to
    # Netdata as an argument, e.g. CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem
    #
    CAfile = /etc/netdata/ssl/ca.crt

    # The API_KEY to use (as the sender)
    api key = XXX

    # Stream Compression
    # The default is enabled
    # You can control stream compression in this agent with options: yes | no
    enable compression = yes

    # The timeout to connect and send metrics
    timeout seconds = 60

    # If the destination line above does not specify a port, use this
    default port = 19999

    # filter the charts to be streamed
    # netdata SIMPLE PATTERN:
    # - space separated list of patterns (use \ to include spaces in patterns)
    # - use * as wildcard, any number of times within each pattern
    # - prefix a pattern with ! for a negative match (ie not stream the charts it matches)
    # - the order of patterns is important (left to right)
    # To send all except a few, use: !this !that *   (ie append a wildcard pattern)
    send charts matching = *

    # The buffer to use for sending metrics.
    # 10MB is good for 60 seconds of data, so increase this if you expect latencies.
    # The buffer is flushed on reconnects (this will not prevent gaps at the charts).
    buffer size bytes = 10485760

    # If the connection fails, or it disconnects,
    # retry after that many seconds.
    reconnect delay seconds = 5

    # Sync the clock of the charts for that many iterations, when starting.
    # It is ignored when replication is enabled
    initial clock resync iterations = 60
